## Important to run this project
You need to add your api key on this file credentials.properties to be able to run the app Get it from Here: https://developer.accuweather.com/user/login 

## Notes
- I chose AccuWeather because it provides free access to city search and weather search. However, it limits the forecast to 5 days instead of the required 7 days. Nevertheless, I believe this still fulfills the required functionality.
- Applied unit test with this coverage (SearchCityViewModel: 100% - WeatherViewModel: 87%) / (Weather State Local Library: 96%) / (Core Module:50%) / (Repository and Api in Data Module/ 100%) / (Features Modules Use Cases: 100%).


## Bonus
- Applied the weather state handler as library using MavenLocal 
- Applied the instrumented test to test AppDataStore functionality 
- Applied Dark Mode  
- Appliced CI/CD on Github Actions
